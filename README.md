# Store Management System
This project is based on store management. I take Reliance store as an example.
It is a project made by the help of python and python's module tkinter.
Python modules need in this project :
1) Tkinter
2) sqlite3
 It is based on first man perception project i.e you are admin as well as you are user.
 You don't need to install tkinter as well as sqlite as it is pre installed in python's latest versions like 3.x
